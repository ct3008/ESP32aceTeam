code in espaceteamDone.ino

Added Changes: 
- Leveling system (timer time decreases as levels increase proportionately to progress, At level 3+ implemented a word scramble method that swaps letters around and also make the commands longer, also implemented a way to add red dots all over the screen whenever you allow the timer to run out, which makes it harder to see and increases in number as a function of level).
- Created rooms where you can only communicate with people in the same rooms
